# WIP: php-chainable-array
This is definitely not the best fluent implementation uppon PHP arrays but it's the
one I did allaong the time.

I open it here to keep a trace of all the discussions and comparisons with others libs
i'd love to use instead.

It's also opened to integrate it with CI tools.
